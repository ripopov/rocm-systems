# ConSan flavors and engines

ConSan exposes the SuperCollider flavor and three engines under the MOI flavor.
They are not four independent implementations at the same abstraction level:

```

SuperCollider asks whether a repeated observation of an LDS access changed. It
implements the core delay-and-redundant-observation technique introduced by
Stephenson et al. in the NVIDIA Research paper
[“SuperCollider: Scalable and Effective Data Race Detection for
CUDA”](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2026-06_supercollider-scalable-and-effective-data-race-detection-cuda)
(PLDI 2026). ConSan's AMD final-ISA rewriting, reporting, and current semantic
contract are its own; it does not inherit every implementation detail or claim
from the CUDA system.

MOI stands for **Memory-Ordering Instrumentation**. Its three engines share a
structured model of accesses, owners, epochs, barriers, and selected atomic
ordering events. They differ mainly in **when** they decide that two accesses
conflict and **how much** execution evidence they retain.

The SuperCollider flavor and all three MOI engines instrument final native GPU
code. In an ordinary run, the HSA tool automatically inventories every
admitted supported site, allocates registers and reports, patches the code
object, and loads the replacement. The user does not select individual sites
or registers.

## One execution, four data paths

In this document, **deferred evidence** means device-resident report state that
survives the instrumented kernel and is consumed later by the host. **Deferred
analysis** means analysis that the host performs when consuming that state; it
does not mean a background device task. Today, automatic report buffers are
consumed by the HSA tool during report teardown.

| Flavor or engine | Inside the device kernel | Deferred device-resident evidence | Host consumption or deferred analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SuperCollider** | Access, delay, repeat or read back, and compare values. | Sticky mismatch marker. | Collect the marker and report value instability; do not reconstruct a race. |
| **MOI Record/Replay** | Publish bounded access and synchronization records. | Bounded event snapshot. | Replay the snapshot through the MOI shadow and ordering model. |
| **MOI Sampled** | Select dynamic instances and publish bounded causal windows. | Bounded sampled windows. | Scan the retained windows and report sampled conflicts, statistical misses, saturation, or lost evidence. |
| **MOI Inline Shadow** | Update exact shadow state and evaluate the supported-form conflict predicate immediately. | Bounded diagnostics for conflicts already decided on the device. | Collect and summarize the attributed diagnostics. |

Each row is one complete execution path. Shared host setup before execution is
described below rather than repeated in every row.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Phase or property | SuperCollider | MOI Record/Replay | MOI Sampled | MOI Inline Shadow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core question | Did a repeated/read-back value change after a delay? | Do the retained events form a conflict under the MOI model? | Does the selected subset of dynamic events expose a conflict? | Does this access conflict with the prior shadow state right now? |
| Inside the device kernel | Preserve the original access, delay, repeat a load or read back a store, compare values, and set a mismatch marker. | Publish bounded access records and supported barrier, atomic, and fence evidence. It does not ordinarily decide access conflicts in the kernel. | Apply deterministic runtime selection and publish compact watchpoints plus synchronization metadata for selected causal windows. | Atomically publish/read exact shadow cells, update owner/epoch/order state, evaluate the conflict predicate, and emit a bounded attributed diagnostic. |
| Deferred work | No conflict reconstruction. Only a sticky result waits to be collected. | The main race analysis is deferred: bounded device records wait for host replay. | The ordinary conflict scan is deferred. Only selected windows exist to be scanned. An expert-only immediate adjacent-range GPU check is available but is not part of the ordinary engine behavior. | No main conflict analysis is deferred. Diagnostics wait for collection, but the device already made the supported-form conflict decision. |
| Host after execution | Read the automatic marker and report measured value instability. | Replay visible records through exact-shadow and supported ordering semantics; emit attributed replay conflicts or an honest bounded-snapshot miss. | Scan retained, generation-qualified windows; emit sampled conflicts, saturation/loss information, or an honest statistical miss. | Read device-produced diagnostic records and summarize attribution, capacity, and completeness. |
| Where the useful decision happens | Device value comparison. This is not a happens-before decision. | Host replay. | Host scan by default; optional narrow GPU signal for experiments. | Device conflict check. |
| Synchronization model | None for detection. Barrier/atomic **fault injection** can compose with the value perturbation, but SuperCollider does not reconstruct ordering. | Supported barriers and selected atomics/fences are recorded and modeled during replay. | Supported synchronization metadata is associated with the same sampled causal identity and interpreted during the deferred scan. | Supported barriers advance device epoch state; selected release/acquire atomics use bounded device ordering tables. |
| Retained evidence | One sticky mismatch signal per relevant code object in ordinary automatic mode. | A bounded snapshot of static site slots and synchronization records; optional expert per-lane dynamic append is also bounded. | Bounded immutable watchpoint banks and paired synchronization metadata for selected windows. | Exact shadow slots for admitted LDS cells, bounded ordering state, and first-N structured diagnostics. |
| Main strength | Smallest and easiest perturbation/value-instability signal. | Clearest reference/debug semantics and easiest engine for inspecting the modeled event history. | Broad, lower-overhead statistical coverage without workload-specific sampling knobs. | Strongest supported-form attribution without retaining an exhaustive event trace. |
| Fundamental limitation | A mismatch is not proof of a race, and same-value races can be invisible. | Repeated static sites can overwrite their slot; retained evidence is a bounded snapshot, not execution history. | Sampling can miss races; a clean run is intentionally inconclusive. | Device shadowing and ordering cost more, diagnostics are bounded, and unsupported instruction/order forms remain outside the claim. |

## Measured overhead on RDNA4

These are paired **no-fault** latency ratios on `gfx1201`: instrumented median
divided by the paired uninstrumented baseline median. Thus `1.0x` means no
slowdown at the precision displayed; bug injection is not active during these
measurements. The full provenance-bound clean, fault, and overhead results are
in [STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md), and the measurement procedure is in
[VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md#correct-workload-overhead).

### End-to-end and model-scale workloads

The first four rows are end-to-end LLM executions. CLIP is retained here as a
model-scale vision workload rather than mixing it with isolated kernels.

| Correct workload | SuperCollider | Record/Replay | Sampled | Inline Shadow |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3-0.6B prefill | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.0x |
| Sharktank TP1 prefill | 1.1x | 1.6x | 1.1x | 3.7x |
| Sharktank TP1 decode/combined | 1.0x | 1.2x | 1.0x | 2.0x |
| Sharktank TP2 family | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.3x |
| CLIP BF16 | 1.0x | 1.5x | 1.2x | 1.7x |

### Isolated kernels and micro-workloads

These short P4 workloads expose instrumentation cost rather than representing
whole-model latency. Their much larger factors, especially for SuperCollider,
must not be extrapolated to end-to-end LLM overhead.

| Correct workload | SuperCollider | Record/Replay | Sampled | Inline Shadow |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| hip-moi D128 block attention | 7.7x | 2.1x | 2.1x | 2.1x |
| hip-moi D128 pressure attention | 16.0x | 3.1x | 3.0x | 3.1x |
| hip-moi WMMA attention | 7.0x | 2.1x | 2.0x | 2.1x |
| hip-moi Stream-K arrival | 7.9x | 2.6x | 2.7x | 2.8x |
| hip-moi tree atomic-OR | 9.1x | 2.7x | 2.8x | 2.9x |
| Jakub attention variants | 4.6x | 2.2x | 2.2x | 2.3x |

## What is common, and what is not

### Shared host work before execution

Before any instrumented kernel runs, the flavor and all three engines use the
same broad pipeline:

1. The HSA tools hook intercepts a final native code object.
2. ConSan decodes and inventories sites, kernel ownership, resources, and
   synchronization shapes relevant to the selected flavor and engine.
3. The hook plans exact automatic report storage under fixed safety ceilings.
4. Register allocation selects dead or fresh registers and uses the reusable
   spilling backend when required.
5. Patching is transactional: unsupported placement or validation returns no
   partially transformed image.
6. The runtime loads the validated replacement code object.

This common setup explains why “host-side” does not mean “host replay.” Host
replay is specific to Record/Replay and, in a lower-fidelity sampled form, to
Sampled. SuperCollider and Inline Shadow still need substantial host setup and
report collection even though their useful decision occurs on the GPU.

### Different meanings of a diagnostic

- **SuperCollider** reports a changed redundant observation. It deliberately
  does not name a racing peer or prove a missing happens-before edge.
- **Record/Replay** reports a conflict reconstructed from the bounded records
  that remained visible to the host model.
- **Sampled** reports a conflict found in retained sampled windows. A miss says
  only that this campaign did not retain a conflicting pair.
- **Inline Shadow** reports a conflict evaluated on the device against the
  previous exact shadow entry for a supported cell and ordering form.

“Exact” in Inline Shadow and the Record/Replay model means exact within the
declared supported forms and retained capacities. It is not a claim that an
unsupported site or dropped diagnostic was race-free. Coverage, saturation,
overflow, and dynamic-completeness evidence remain part of every accepted run.

## Choosing a flavor and engine

For most structured investigations, start with the **MOI Record/Replay**
engine. It combines a clean, inspectable host-side model with broad static-site
instrumentation and measured end-to-end LLM overhead of `1.0x` to `1.6x` in
the current RDNA4 ledger. This recommendation matches the current behavior of
`RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=moi`, which selects Record/Replay when
`RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE` is unset.

That recommendation is not a completeness claim. Record/Replay retains a
bounded snapshot, and repeated executions of a static site can overwrite
earlier dynamic evidence. Consequently, complete static patch coverage does
not imply complete dynamic-history retention or fault-detection sensitivity;
a clean replay remains inconclusive.

- Choose **MOI Inline Shadow** when the strongest current supported-form,
  immediate device-side attribution matters more than its higher device work.
- Choose **MOI Sampled** for broad statistical campaigns where lower retained
  state matters more than detecting every individual manifestation.
- Choose the **SuperCollider flavor** for its complementary
  perturbation/value-instability signal, especially when structured causality
  is unnecessary or MOI's bounded evidence misses the manifestation.

The measured workload-by-flavor/engine tradeoffs are recorded in
[STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md). Commands and ordinary no-tuning defaults
are in [USAGE.md](USAGE.md), while [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) defines the detailed
algorithms, report layouts, instruction coverage, and semantic boundaries.
