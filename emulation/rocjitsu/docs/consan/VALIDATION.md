# ConSan Validation

This guide explains the reproducible experiment behind the support table in
[STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md). The executable authority is
[`consan_validation.py`](../../tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py): it owns the
workload manifest, instrumentation profiles, commands, timeouts, knob hygiene,
coverage gates, overhead calculation, and fault-containment policy. Prefer a
script change with tests over copying another command into this document.

[USAGE.md](USAGE.md) remains the complete setting reference,
[SPILLING.md](SPILLING.md) explains ConSan's resource-policy integration, the
reusable backend is documented in
[AMDGPU register spilling](../spilling.md), and
[STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md) is the concise published result ledger.

The status table began as a cumulative ledger: its rows were promoted at
different frozen checkpoints and some predated today's stronger completeness
and overhead wording. These scripts define one-tip requalification; they do
not manufacture old colors. The 2026-07-16 campaign demonstrated that rule by
temporarily demoting five cells when stronger evidence contradicted them, then
restoring them only after focused fixes and exact-tip reruns.

The completed gfx1201 certificate uses executable commit `640e575da2` and hook
SHA-256 `c45aa0fece5a9aa7ef8b3ad24bcbb2077e477586df6b4eecf12990f7fafa693d`.
It accepts all 55 clean baseline/profile rows, all 14 reviewed exact fault
policies, and all 66 paired-overhead result rows across 11 workloads. The
unrounded ratios and raw commands remain in the generated artifacts; the
rounded current-tip values are published in [STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md).

## Workspace contract

Set one root containing the external projects and build outputs:

```sh
export CONSAN_VALIDATION_WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/workspace
export CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET=gfx1201
```

The runner expects these paths beneath that root:

```text
iree-test-suites/
iree-test-suites-build/
hip-moi/
hip-moi-build/
rocjitsu-build/
```

For compatibility with the original gfx1201 workspace, it also recognizes
`rocjitsu-main-gpu-build/` as the rocJITsu build name. The hook must be at
`lib/rocjitsu/src/rocjitsu/hooks/librocjitsu_dbi_hooks.so` inside that build.

`iree-run-module`, `iree-benchmark-module`, and `rocminfo` are resolved from
`PATH`; IREE is not vendored or found through a machine-specific build path.
The Python used to launch the runner must be able to import the IREE Python
bindings needed by the Sharktank tests.

Run the preflight before GPU work:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" doctor
```

The doctor reports every missing checkout, artifact, workload executable,
hook, and tool. It performs no GPU dispatch.

## Inspecting the executable contract

The checked-in prose does not duplicate commands or fault expectations that
can drift away from the runner. `manifest` gives the compact matrix, while
`explain` derives an audit view from the same command, environment, and fault
policy functions used during execution:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" manifest

python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" manifest --json > manifest.json

python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" explain \
  --workload all --profile all
```

The JSON contains all north-star workloads, four canonical profiles, admitted
fault families, fixed timeout, forbidden exploratory controls, and the maximum
GPU parallelism. Review it before starting a campaign and retain it with the
results.

For an exact, machine-readable pre-run audit, include the reviewed fault spec:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" explain \
  --workload all --profile all \
  --spec /path/to/reviewed-faults.json --json > validation-audit.json
```

For every selected workload, `validation-audit.json` contains:

- the exact argument arrays used for clean correctness and overhead, plus the
  top-level validator invocation template and process/repetition count;
- every harness-supplied setting for each profile, with inherited shell
  settings excluded and each setting classified, plus the ordinary runtime
  defaults on which the command deliberately relies;
- every admitted injection from the reviewed spec, including its exact machine
  selector and fault payload command;
- the precommitted detector and independent-oracle outcome for each flavor;
- the human-readable diagnostic requirement, deterministic or statistical
  trial count, trial overrides, policy overrides and unsets; and
- the fully merged effective setting set for every fault trial.

The human form intentionally summarizes long identities. `--json` is the
authority for exact selectors and per-trial environments. Actual `result.json`
files remain the post-run authority for what executed.

Settings are classified in a totally explicit way:

| Category | Meaning | Usability interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime-plumbing` | Locates the hook or target | Required setup, not coverage tuning |
| `instrumentation-selection` | Selects flavor or engine; can explicitly override synchronization defaults | Ordinary MOI automatically enables barrier and atomic tracking |
| `acceptance-assertion` | Turns missing records, incomplete patching, unexpected diagnostics, or overflow into failure | Cannot help a row pass |
| `workload-tuning` | Changes a workload-specific operating point | Marked `usability_exception: true` |
| `fault-injection` | Selects an exact deliberate mutation | Experiment control, not an ordinary user setting |
| `fault-containment` | Serializes destructive GPU work | Experiment safety control |

The audit also repeats the forbidden ordinary controls. A qualifying clean row
must not use a site cap, kernel filter, manually selected temporary register,
scratch register, MOI metadata register, or force-spill setting. Consequently,
a reviewer can distinguish instrumentation selection from settings that would
artificially make a difficult workload smaller.

The top-level `usability_audit` makes that conclusion queryable. It lists any
forbidden coverage-limiting control that actually appeared, workload-specific
tuning, automatic event-family defaults, explicit expert overrides, and
fault-only acceptance guards relaxed by a reviewed policy. An empty
`coverage_limiting_controls_present` is evidence that the clean profiles did
not qualify by narrowing patch coverage. An empty
`explicit_event_family_overrides` confirms that qualification relied on the
ordinary MOI defaults: both barrier and atomic tracking are enabled without a
user setting.

Without `--spec`, `explain` shows inventory templates and prints
`REVIEW_REQUIRED` instead of pretending that detector outcomes have been
chosen. Historical gfx1201 evidence can be inspected, but never executed, with:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target gfx1201 explain --workload all --profile all \
  --spec emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation_faults_gfx1201_reference.json \
  --allow-reference --json > gfx1201-historical-audit.json
```

`--allow-reference` only permits read-only explanation. The `fault` subcommand
continues to reject the cumulative reference file.

The current manifest covers Qwen3-0.6B prefill; Sharktank TP1 prefill and
decode/combined, TP2, and CLIP BF16; and the hip-moi D128, WMMA, Stream-K,
tree-atomic-OR, and Jakub workloads. The profile IDs are `supercollider`,
`record-replay`, `sampled`, and `inline-shadow`.

## Clean correctness and coverage

Choose a new artifact root. A row directory must not already exist:

```sh
export CONSAN_ARTIFACT_ROOT="$CONSAN_VALIDATION_WORKSPACE_DIR/consan-validation/run-001"

python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" run \
  --workload qwen-prefill --profile all --phase clean \
  --include-baseline --artifact-root "$CONSAN_ARTIFACT_ROOT"
```

Replace `qwen-prefill` with any ID printed by `manifest`. Each process starts
after removing inherited `HSA_TOOLS_LIB` and every `RJ_CONSAN_*` setting. The
runner then applies only the named canonical profile. This prevents a
coverage-limiting setting, kernel filter, explicit temporary register,
force-spill control, or stale sampling setting from silently qualifying a cell.

An instrumented clean row is accepted only when:

- the workload's independent numerical or semantic oracle passes;
- ConSan reports an applicable code object and no dynamic-incomplete result;
- every supported access, barrier, atomic, and fence site is patched;
- MOI emits no unexpected clean diagnostic and no forbidden overflow; and
- every repeated process satisfies the same coverage gate.

No clean profile currently has a workload-specific tuning exception. In
particular, Qwen Sampled relies on the ordinary `standard-v1` runtime profile:
stride 16,384 and offset zero are automatic runtime defaults, not environment
settings supplied by the validation harness. `explain --json` records those
values under `implicit_runtime_defaults`, while `workload_specific_tuning`
remains empty.

## Correct-workload overhead

Overhead is measured without fault injection:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" run \
  --workload tp1-prefill --profile all --phase overhead \
  --include-baseline --artifact-root "$CONSAN_ARTIFACT_ROOT"
```

With `--include-baseline`, the execution order is baseline-before, the selected
instrumented profiles, then baseline-after. `summary.json` reports the paired
baseline as the mean of the two baseline medians, each mode-specific slowdown,
and the maximum mode ratio used for the support-table cell:

```text
slowdown = instrumented median / paired baseline median
```

Qwen uses ten benchmark dispatch repetitions. Sharktank performs an untimed
warmup and retains call samples. CLIP and hip-moi rows use fresh processes as
declared by the manifest. Raw samples, commands, complete controlled
environment, hook hash, source revisions, and unrounded ratios remain in the
artifact tree.

## Fault inventory and reviewed specs

Fault identities contain code-object hashes, kernel names, PCs, mnemonics, and
occurrences. They are intentionally not hard-coded into the portable manifest.
Regenerate them after changing a target, compiler, workload, or binary:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" inventory \
  --workload tp1-prefill --artifact-root "$CONSAN_ARTIFACT_ROOT"
```

This runs each admitted fault family separately with
`RJ_CONSAN_FAULT_DRY_RUN=1`. Family-specific analysis is enabled, but no site
identity is selected and no mutation is applied. It retains each raw log as
`command-<family>.log` and records per-family plus deduplicated aggregate
sites, synchronization sequences, and barrier destinations in
`inventory.json`. It also creates
`fault-spec.template.json` for the workload's admitted fault families.

Review the inventory before mutation. In the copied spec:

1. replace every `REPLACE_FROM_INVENTORY` value with an exact compatible
   identity;
2. precommit `detector` as `detected`, `not_detected`, or `statistical` for
   every profile; a statistical policy also sets `minimum_detections`;
3. precommit the workload `oracle` as `pass`, `fail`, or `any`;
4. add a `trials` list under a profile when a statistical campaign requires
   predeclared overrides, such as Qwen Sampled offsets; and
5. set top-level `review_required` to `false` only after that review.

A profile may instead have `"disposition": "not-applicable"` when the
inventory proves the fault family is semantically absent. This is recorded as
typed N/A and performs no mutation. Do not choose a different site or expected
outcome after observing a run.

Profile policy can also contain an `environment` object or an `unset` list.
These are retained as part of the experiment, not hidden shell tuning. The
gfx1201 policy uses `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_REQUIRE_DIAGNOSTICS=1` for deterministic
Inline catches and unsets the clean overflow guard only for the two accepted
fault rows whose useful diagnostic is intentionally retained in a bounded
buffer with disclosed duplicate-report drops.

The cumulative gfx1201 ledger is checked in as
`consan_validation_faults_gfx1201_reference.json`. It records the historical
selectors, deterministic qualified misses/detections, oracle outcomes, and
32-offset Qwen Sampled campaign behind the current table. That historical
fault campaign explicitly retains stride 256 in its profile policy; this does
not alter the untuned clean profile. It is reference data, not a runnable
default: its rows came from different frozen checkpoints, and a later analyzer
may deliberately reject an old association. Copy the relevant values into the
generated template only after a fresh inventory proves that every identity and
expectation still applies. The runner refuses the reference-only file itself;
exact-one mutation makes stale reviewed identities fail closed.

Example reviewed profile policy:

```json
{
  "sampled": {
    "detector": "statistical",
    "minimum_detections": 1,
    "oracle": "any",
    "trials": [
      {"RJ_CONSAN_MOI_RUNTIME_SAMPLE_OFFSET": "0"},
      {"RJ_CONSAN_MOI_RUNTIME_SAMPLE_OFFSET": "1"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Contained fault execution

Fault runs are serialized and require an explicit destructive acknowledgement:

```sh
python3 emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py \
  --target "$CONSAN_VALIDATION_TARGET" fault \
  --workload tp1-prefill --profile all \
  --spec /path/to/reviewed-tp1-faults.json --fault barrier-drop \
  --artifact-root "$CONSAN_ARTIFACT_ROOT" --allow-destructive
```

The top-level runner delegates each trial to
[`consan_fault_runner.py`](../../tests/dbi/consan/consan_fault_runner.py). That runner
creates a process group, holds the global destructive-GPU lock, enforces the
deadline, captures original/patched code objects, runs `rocminfo` plus an IREE
smoke before and after, and quarantines the artifact root if health fails.

Promotion requires all of the following to match the reviewed spec:

- mutation accounting is exactly `requested=1 planned=1 applied=1`;
- the detector result is the precommitted deterministic value, or a
  statistical campaign reaches its precommitted minimum detection count;
- the independent oracle matches its precommitted result when not `any`;
- the process does not time out; and
- both device-health gates pass.

A timeout, trap, crash, output mismatch, or GPU reset is not a ConSan
detection. The fault runner retains these as distinct execution outcomes.
GoogleTest assertions, IREE expected-output checks, and the Sharktank wrapper
are converted into explicit oracle evidence rather than inferred from ConSan.

## Campaign discipline and porting

Run no more than four GPU jobs concurrently. Fault rows are always serialized.
Use a new artifact root after any source, hook, workload, manifest, settings,
or reviewed fault-spec change. Never merge exploratory output into an accepted
campaign.

For a new gfx architecture:

1. implement and test its instruction builder, branch forms, waits, descriptor
   growth, register allocation, and spill backend;
2. build target-native versions of every applicable workload;
3. run `doctor`, retain `manifest --json`, and pass clean rows;
4. inventory every fault family and review new target-specific specs;
5. run overhead and contained fault rows against one frozen commit; and
6. update [STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md) only from the generated results.

Do not copy gfx1201 coverage denominators, machine-code identities, or timing
factors to another target. A port is credible when another engineer can use
the same scripts to distinguish an ISA-backend failure, a spill/resource
failure, a workload-oracle failure, a stale fault selector, a detector miss,
and infrastructure/device loss.

## Testing the validation scripts

The orchestration and containment logic has CPU-only unit coverage:

```sh
cd emulation/rocjitsu/tests/dbi/consan
python3 -m unittest \
  test_consan_coverage_gate.py \
  test_consan_fault_runner.py \
  test_consan_run_provenance.py \
  test_consan_validation.py
```

These tests do not qualify a GPU cell. They protect the executable protocol:
environment scrubbing, profile isolation, workload commands, overhead math,
identity inventory, fault-spec validation, and workload-oracle parsing.
