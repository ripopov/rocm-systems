# ConSan Register Allocation and Spilling

This document describes how ConSan selects temporary registers, proves that a
choice is valid for every owning kernel, and integrates RocJitsu's spill
backend with code-object loading and dispatch.

The reusable allocator, gfx1201 save/restore sequences, descriptor helper,
support boundary, provenance, and focused tests are documented in
[AMDGPU register spilling](../spilling.md). This guide covers only the
ConSan-specific policy layered on that backend.

## Allocation policy

Native DBI probes run inside an already allocated kernel. Choosing a convenient
register number globally is unsafe: the guest may use it, and shared helper
text may be reached by kernels with different register and private-segment
layouts.

For each ConSan probe request, the resource planner tries these outcomes in
order:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Explicit override | Use a requested debug register window only when it does not overlap instruction operands, persistent state, or live guest values. |
| Liveness-dead | Reuse a window inside the current descriptor allocation that is dead before the instrumented instruction. |
| Descriptor growth | Allocate a fresh window above every guest reference and grow each owning descriptor to cover it. |
| Spill required | Borrow an allowed live window, save it to per-lane private scratch, run the probe, and restore it before guest execution resumes. |
| Unsupported | Do not patch; retain a typed reason such as missing ownership, forbidden overlap, a full scalar file, unsupported dynamic-stack use, or an unencodable private layout. |

Explicit environment variables are encoding and debugging controls. They do
not bypass liveness, ownership, or overlap checks, and ordinary validation
profiles do not require them.

The ordinary-VGPR architectural limit is 256. Scalar preservation uses fresh
descriptor-backed SGPR windows; ConSan does not implement an SGPR spill stack.
A probe requiring new scalar state fails explicitly when no safe window exists.

SuperCollider's indirect path reserves disjoint scalar state above the owning
kernel's maximum referenced SGPR: VCC preservation, an SCC save, and an aligned
PC pair. It captures SCC before the cave and restores it after return-PC
arithmetic. Final validation checks ownership, allocation, disjointness, and
the exact entry and return encodings.

## Site ownership

ConSan decodes symbol-backed ranges into basic blocks, builds a CFG scope from
each kernel entry, and runs liveness within that scope. Call edges associate a
helper block with every kernel that can reach it.

For a direct-kernel site there is one owner. For shared text, one plan must be
valid for all owners. It uses:

- the union of owner live-before sets, so a dead window is dead for every
  caller;
- the smallest current VGPR allocation, so an in-allocation window exists in
  every caller;
- the largest referenced VGPR and SGPR indices, so fresh growth is above all
  guest state;
- the maximum original private size as the base for a common spill layout; and
- one register assignment and instruction sequence for the shared bytes.

Every descriptor that can reach the helper receives the required register and
private extent. Unrelated descriptors remain unchanged. Unreachable or
unresolved indirect text is a missing-owner result; even an explicit override
does not guess that every descriptor owns it.

Persistent InlineShadow state follows the same rule. Shared text either uses
one owner/epoch VGPR representation for every owner or one common private-state
layout. Work-item-ID-derived private ownership additionally requires all owners
to agree on wave size.

## ConSan private layout

The shared backend appends stable spill slots after the maximum original
per-lane private extent. ConSan may reserve a persistent prefix inside that
DBI-owned region before allocating ephemeral spill slots:

```text
guest private | alignment | persistent epoch/owner state | spill leases
```

InlineShadow prefers two descriptor-backed VGPRs for owner and epoch state,
even when that requires safe descriptor growth. Keeping hot-path state in
registers is cheaper than reloading it at every access. If the pair cannot fit,
the persistent epoch dword precedes the entry-captured owner dword in private
memory. Access, prologue, barrier, and atomic spill leases start above that
prefix so temporary state cannot overlap persistent state.

For a shared spill, every owner uses the same slot offsets and grows to the same
required private extent. Mixed fixed/dynamic ownership and unknown owners fail
closed.

## Dynamic-stack integration

The qualified gfx1201 dynamic-stack path uses the compiler convention observed
in the Jakub attention object: `s32` is the stack top and `s33` is the current
frame base. InlineShadow access probes use the shared backend's site-local
dynamic frame only after ownership analysis proves this recipe applies.

ConSan supplies safe scalar save registers, preserves SCC and the incoming
frame, borrows the VGPR window, and restores all state before resuming guest
code. Automatic scalar allocation excludes `s32:s33`, whose implicit stack
roles need not appear as decoded operands.

The descriptor and dispatch packet grow by the maximum added frame depth so
the runtime allocates backing storage. The emitted scratch accesses remain
relative to the runtime frame. The qualified recipe currently applies only to
InlineShadow access probes; other dynamic-stack spill consumers and mixed
fixed/dynamic shared ownership are rejected.

## Code-object and dispatch transaction

ConSan coordinates the static spill helpers with its HSA runtime integration:

1. Plan ownership, registers, private layout, and encodings without mutating
   the code object.
2. Grow only owning kernel descriptors and enable private storage when a
   zero-private kernel first needs it.
3. Leave AMDGPU MessagePack notes untouched; ROCR does not use their duplicated
   private-size entries as runtime authority.
4. Commit descriptor and text changes through `CodeObjectPatcher`.
5. Associate the private requirement with the loaded kernel object.
6. Rewrite the AQL dispatch packet's private-segment size before submission.

When text growth moves later ELF contents, ConSan resolves the active
descriptor by kernel name instead of retaining a stale pre-growth file offset.
A failed plan does not intentionally leave a partially instrumented image for
loading.

Separately from spill storage, ConSan currently combines the compiler-emitted
`.sgpr_count` analysis hint with decoded references before placing dispatch
state or transient EXEC/VCC/SCC windows. It never uses that hint to reduce a
decoded bound, and it does not rewrite the note. Replacing all analysis-note
inputs with descriptor- and instruction-derived facts is a distinct follow-up
from removing private-size mutation.

## Current ConSan support

| Probe family | Current resource path |
|---|---|
| Record/replay access probes | Dead, fresh-growth, and spill-backed VGPR windows. |
| Sampled access probes | Dead, fresh-growth, and spill-backed VGPR windows. |
| InlineShadow access probes | Dead, fresh-growth, and spill-backed VGPR windows, including private-epoch fallback. |
| Reachable shared helpers | One all-owner-compatible dead, fresh, or common spill plan. |
| Private-epoch entry/barrier temporaries | Saved and restored through the gfx1201 private path. |
| Dynamic scalar state | Automatic descriptor-backed SGPR windows with EXEC, VCC, and SCC preservation. |
| Barrier and atomic VGPR temporaries | Dead, fresh-growth, and spill-backed common plans. |
| SGPR or AccVGPR spilling | Not implemented. |
| Dynamic-stack kernels | Qualified InlineShadow access recipe; other spill consumers fail closed. |
| Unresolved indirect ownership | Not instrumented. |

This is narrower than a compiler register allocator. It is the semantically
safe resource path needed by the implemented probes while keeping the shared
backend replaceable and independently reusable.

## Failure reporting

ConSan preserves backend and policy failures as typed outcomes. Important
examples include:

- missing ownership or unresolved indirect control flow;
- no assignment valid across all owners;
- overlap with an instruction operand or persistent state;
- invalid descriptor or private-segment growth;
- dynamic-stack use outside the qualified recipe;
- incompatible owner wave sizes;
- branch, cave, or relocated-prefix placement failure; and
- unsupported target or register class.

The HSA log distinguishes explicit, dead, descriptor-growth, spill, and
unsupported plans. It reports planned and emitted spill bytes, site kind,
typed reason, and a bounded owner list. A resource rejection is therefore
distinguishable from a successfully instrumented run that found no race.

## Tests and workload evidence

The focused host loop is:

```sh
"$ROCJITSU_BUILD_DIR/tests/rocjitsu_tests" \
  --gtest_filter='ConSanResourcePlan.*:ConSanMoi.*:SpillManager.*:InstructionBuilder.*'
```

The live gfx1201 spill tests are:

```sh
ctest --test-dir "$ROCJITSU_BUILD_DIR" -j4 --output-on-failure \
  -R '^(ConSanSpillHipTest|ConSanInlineShadowTest|ConSanMoiHipTest)\.'
```

These cover forced live-VGPR preservation, zero-to-nonzero dispatch backing,
private-epoch barriers, InlineShadow diagnostics, and atomic handoff without
register-number configuration.

The real Jakub attention qualification exercises 15 dynamic-stack access
sites with 18-VGPR frames. It patches all admitted accesses and barriers and
passes the independent numerical variants. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md)
for the executable experiment contract and
[STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md) for measured workload results.
