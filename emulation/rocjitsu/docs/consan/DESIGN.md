# ConSan design

ConSan is rocJITsu's dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) sanitizer for AMD
LDS/shared-memory concurrency bugs. Its MOI flavor is Memory-Ordering
Instrumentation. ConSan intercepts GPU code-object loads through the HSA tools
interface, inspects final native machine code, and loads a validated patched
replacement when the selected flavor and engine can instrument it.

The current implementation and tests are centered on the local RDNA4 /
`gfx1201` GPU because that is the hardware available in this workspace. That is
an incidental validation focus, not the intended product boundary. The intended
native-instrumentation target set is `gfx942`, `gfx950`, `gfx1201`, and
`gfx1250`. ConSan is not meant to translate kernels between GPU ISAs; it should
patch the final code object for the architecture that will actually run.

This document describes the current implementation, its invariants, and its
explicit limitations. [FLAVORS.md](FLAVORS.md) gives a phase-by-phase
conceptual comparison of the SuperCollider flavor and three MOI engines,
including the device, deferred, and host responsibilities.
[SPILLING.md](SPILLING.md) describes ConSan's register selection, ownership,
and runtime integration; the reusable RocJitsu backend is documented separately
in [AMDGPU register spilling](../spilling.md).
[STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md) records current gfx1201 workload evidence;
[FUTURE_WORK.md](FUTURE_WORK.md) tracks post-green release, detector-quality,
containment, breadth, and portability work.

## Current status at a glance

| Area | Implemented today | Boundary or direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interception | HSA-tools hook via `HSA_TOOLS_LIB`. | Keep HSA-tools as the main path. |
| Architecture | Native RDNA4 / `gfx1201` implementation and validation. | Generalize the native patching path for `gfx942`, `gfx950`, `gfx1201`, and `gfx1250`; do not translate between targets. |
| Public selection | `RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=supercollider` or `RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=moi`; MOI then selects one of three engines. | Keep the two-level flavor/engine model. |
| SuperCollider | Delayed redundant LDS and admitted group-flat observations with an automatic mismatch marker. | Keep as a complementary perturbation/value-instability flavor. |
| MOI Record/Replay | Bounded device records plus host replay. This is the recommended starting engine. | Preserve clear reference/debug semantics while making snapshot limits explicit. |
| MOI Inline Shadow | Immediate supported-form shadow checks for admitted LDS accesses, barriers, and selected atomic ordering. | Broaden proven instruction and ordering coverage without weakening typed exclusions. |
| MOI Sampled | Deterministically selected causal windows plus deferred host analysis. | Improve statistical sensitivity while keeping clean runs explicitly inconclusive. |
| Ordinary operation | The `standard-v1` settings select all admitted supported sites and allocate registers and reports automatically on the qualified gfx1201 workloads. | Expand instruction and architecture breadth without introducing workload-specific setup. |
| Registers | Owner-scoped liveness plans use dead or fresh registers and the reusable gfx1201 VGPR spilling backend where required; special state is preserved explicitly. | Extend reusable spilling only for concrete register classes and target needs. |
| Diagnostics | Bounded inline and sampled diagnostics plus resource, overflow, and unsupported-site summaries; compact shadow words limit prior-lane detail. | Preserve bounded output while improving precision and presentation. |
| Flat/generic LDS | Explicit `likely`/`strict` admission policy over `Group`/`MaybeGroup`, with a normalized RDNA4 group-flat address contract. | Extend proven provenance conservatively as compiler code shapes and native targets broaden. |

## Source map

ConSan is contained under focused subdirectories wherever the code is specific
to the sanitizer. Shared files retain only reusable binary-patching machinery
or small integration calls. Paths in this section are relative to

## Public flavor and engine model

ConSan has a two-level public selection.

Top-level flavor:

```sh
RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=supercollider
RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=moi
```

MOI engine, used only with `RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=moi`:

```sh
RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=record_replay
RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=inline_shadow
RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=sampled
```

The legacy `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_BACKEND` names remain compatibility aliases:

- `context` maps to `record_replay`.
- `sampled_watchpoint` maps to `sampled`.

The public terminology is:

- `supercollider`: simple perturbation plus redundant-access checking.
- `moi`: structured memory-order instrumentation.
- `record_replay`: bounded device recording plus host-side reference/debug
  replay. It is the recommended starting engine.
- `inline_shadow`: immediate supported-form GPU-side shadow checking.
- `sampled`: statistical MOI with bounded retained causal windows.

## Ordinary MOI operation and boundaries

On gfx1201, MOI has the same broad "turn it on" operation as SuperCollider.
Selecting the flavor is sufficient because Record/Replay is the MOI default;
the versioned `standard-v1` settings supply resources, reports, and
synchronization tracking. Commands that must be reproducible should still name
the engine explicitly. All three engines pass the admitted real-workload
matrix. This is an operational claim, not a claim that every loaded instruction
is supported or that every engine has identical sensitivity.

The implementation boundary is:

- **Scratch register allocation.** Record/Replay, Sampled, and Inline Shadow
  access, barrier, and atomic probes choose per-site dead or fresh
  descriptor-backed VGPR windows and spill allowed live windows when needed.
  Shared helpers use one plan valid for every owning kernel. Scalar and
  persistent state are automatic too. The reusable allocation and gfx1201
  save/restore backend, including its Kunwar Grover provenance, is documented
  in [AMDGPU register spilling](../spilling.md).
- **Owner and epoch state.** `inline_shadow` automatically uses a persistent
  descriptor-backed pair or derived-owner/private-epoch state. The packed
  identity contract is intentionally bounded and architecture-sensitive.
- **Report-buffer capacity.** MOI can use HSA-tool-owned auto report buffers,
  which is the ordinary path for applications such as IREE. After final-code
  inventory, the hook computes an exact engine-specific layout and allocates
  the required bytes under a 16 MiB per-buffer and 256 MiB process ceiling.
  It reports saturation, undercoverage, overflow, and dropped evidence
  separately. Expert cap, caller-buffer, and zero-disable overrides remain.
- **Versioned ordinary settings.** `record_replay`, `inline_shadow`, and
  `sampled` use `standard-v1`: all admitted supported sites,
  inventory-derived reports, automatic resources, and barrier/atomic tracking.
  Dynamic records and immediate sampled checking remain explicit expert
  extensions. Startup logs identify the settings version and override source.
- **Instruction coverage.** Inline Shadow handles supported native multi-cell
  DS ranges and admitted zero-offset group-flat forms through the same shadow
  publisher, including the admitted d16 forms. Unsupported encodings,
  address shapes, and provenance remain visible typed exclusions rather than
  speculative instrumentation.
- **Patch placement and text growth.** All MOI engines and SuperCollider use a
  shared transactional planner for inline padding, local caves, and appended
  caves. A failed plan does not leave partial descriptor/text mutations.
- **Flat/generic LDS provenance.** Compilers can emit flat accesses for source
  `__shared__` memory. Inventory distinguishes proven `Group`, heuristic
  `MaybeGroup`, private, and unknown forms. `strict` admits only proven `Group`;
  `likely` also admits `MaybeGroup`, with exclusions reported explicitly.
- **Barrier and atomic ordering.** Barriers and selected atomics are ordering
  evidence for LDS races, not global-memory checks. Record/Replay is the
  semantic oracle; Inline uses bounded address-scoped release/acquire state;
  Sampled attaches supported barrier, atomic, and fence evidence to its causal
  windows. Every ordinary MOI engine enables admitted barriers and atomics.
- **Diagnostics.** `inline_shadow` emits bounded first-N diagnostics with
  instruction offsets, access kinds, owners, epoch, LDS byte ranges, the
  current conflict EXEC mask, and visible overflow. The prior writer's lane
  mask is unavailable in the compact exact-shadow word and is reported as
  unknown/zero.
- **Runtime sampling policy.** `sampled` leaves every admitted static site
  patched under ordinary settings, then applies deterministic runtime
  selection before deferred host scanning. An immediate adjacent-range
  in-kernel check remains an expert extension.
- **Architecture dispatch.** Local validation is on `gfx1201`, but the intended
  target set is `gfx942`, `gfx950`, `gfx1201`, and `gfx1250`. Broad operation
  needs ISA-specific capability checks and encoders instead of implicit RDNA4
  assumptions.
- **Test parity.** The portable validation runner owns current workload
  commands, settings, clean/fault expectations, overhead, provenance, and
  health gates. Measured results are in [STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md);
  test counts are discovered rather than frozen in this design document.

The recommended ordinary invocation is:

```sh
env HSA_TOOLS_LIB=/path/to/librocjitsu_dbi_hooks.so \
  RJ_CONSAN_FLAVOR=moi \
  RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=record_replay \
  ./application
```

Use `inline_shadow` or `sampled` only when their different sensitivity,
retained-state, and overhead trade-offs are desired. Ordinary runs do not
require site, register, report-buffer, barrier, atomic, or sampling selection.

## Interception and code-object flow

The HSA hook wraps the code-object load path. For each memory-backed code
object, it:

1. Refreshes runtime configuration from environment variables.
2. Reads the original code-object bytes.
3. Runs ConSan inventory and patch planning.
4. Emits modified bytes when the selected flavor and engine can patch at least
   one site.
5. Loads the replacement memory-backed code object.
6. Logs a compact summary when `RJ_CONSAN_LOG` is enabled.

This path does not translate the program to a different ISA. The target remains
the original native code object for the GPU that will execute the kernel.

`RJ_CONSAN_REQUIRE_PATCH=1` is the main non-vacuity guard. It rejects a code
object when ConSan finds supported candidates for the selected flavor and
engine but cannot patch any such candidate. It still lets unsupported code
objects load normally.

`RJ_CONSAN_DUMP_DIR=/path` writes original and patched code objects for
inspection.

## Shared DBI constraints

ConSan is a post-register-allocation binary patcher. That imposes constraints
that a compiler pass would not have:

- It must decode final machine instructions.
- It must find or create patch placement.
- It must preserve architectural state such as VCC and EXEC.
- It must avoid clobbering live SGPRs/VGPRs.
- It must update AMDHSA kernel descriptors when increasing register allocation.
- It must infer flat/generic address-space provenance from machine-code
  dataflow, not from compiler IR address spaces.

Current placement mechanisms:

- inline replacement when a site has enough trailing `s_nop 0` padding;
- branch to an uncovered local NOP cave when a compact site has a reachable
  cave;
- appended `.text` cave when the object shape is simple enough and branch range
  constraints are satisfied.

`DbiPatchPlacementPlanner` is the shared transactional allocator for these
choices. It records explicit anchor/body/return mappings, reserves the return
branch as part of every cave, and leaves its state unchanged on overlap or
branch-range failure. All MOI access, barrier, and atomic probe families use it,
as do SuperCollider's native LDS and likely-group flat check/trap paths. The
native and flat passes preserve their explicit text/file-coordinate mapping
when they compose, and appended-cave emission rejects stale planned offsets.

Current register policy:

- All ordinary flavors and engines select resources automatically.
  SuperCollider's smaller probes often fit dead or fresh registers, while MOI
  also uses spill-preserved victim windows when necessary.
- Static MOI Record/Replay and Sampled access probes use a read-only,
  kernel-scoped CFG/liveness plan. Each site first searches dead VGPRs within
  its current descriptor allocation, then a fresh range above all guest
  references, growing only the owning descriptor when needed.
- Symbol-backed code ranges exclude alignment padding from CFG decoding, so
  the same planning path works on normal multi-kernel HIP code objects.
- Direct-kernel and reachable shared-helper static Record/Replay and Sampled
  sites consume a typed spill-required outcome. They use an appended cave
  containing the spill save, derived-owner setup, original access,
  conservative LDS wait, instrumentation, spill restore, and return.
- Spill plans grow the owning kernel descriptor. The HSA hook also associates
  that requirement with the loaded kernel object and rewrites its AQL dispatch
  packet, so a compiled private size of zero can become nonzero. ROCR consumes
  those descriptor and packet fields; ConSan does not read or rewrite the
  duplicated MessagePack private-size entry.
- Dynamic record, barrier-record, inline diagnostic, and inline atomic acquire
  paths allocate fresh descriptor-backed scalar windows. Scalar VCC snapshots
  make restoration independent of active lanes; SCC is captured before the
  probe and restored last. Explicit SGPR knobs remain debug overrides.
- When no explicit Inline Shadow owner/epoch pair is supplied, ConSan first
  places a dedicated pair above guest references and the selected scratch
  window, replans scratch with that pair forbidden, and injects a kernel-entry
  initializer. If no pair fits, it derives owner per access and keeps epoch in
  a persistent private dword. The epoch slot precedes an independently aligned
  ephemeral spill zone shared by access, barrier, and entry-prologue leases.
  Shared helpers use one representation for every reachable owner; private
  workitem-derived ownership additionally requires the owners to agree on wave
  size.
- A standalone gfx1201 spill backend allocates stable slots through
  `SpillManager`, emits address-free `scratch_store/load_b32` batches with
  conservative split waits, and grows only the selected descriptor's fixed
  private segment. For the qualified compiler `s32:s33` dynamic-stack
  convention, Inline access probes can instead create a site-local frame,
  preserve the caller frame and SCC, spill the borrowed VGPR window, and grow
  dispatch backing by the maximum added depth.
- Static Record/Replay, Sampled, and descriptor-full Inline Shadow access
  probes consume that backend for direct kernels and reachable shared helpers.
  A shared spill starts above the maximum original private extent and grows
  every owner to the same required size. Mixed fixed/dynamic shared ownership,
  dynamic-stack consumers outside the qualified Inline access recipe, and
  unresolved indirect ownership remain unsupported. No SGPR spill backend is
  present; a full 106-normal-SGPR file fails explicitly.

The generic allocator, gfx1201 spill sequences, descriptor helper,
implementation provenance, and backend tests now live outside ConSan and are
documented in [AMDGPU register spilling](../spilling.md). ConSan owns the
victim-selection, multi-owner, code-placement, logging, and dispatch policies
described in [SPILLING.md](SPILLING.md).

If ConSan needs SGPR spilling before rocJITsu has a shared implementation, the
right near-term response is a minimal ConSan-local SGPR spill/fill path for the
specific probe shape that needs it, not a comprehensive spill allocator.

This resource path is qualified for the current gfx1201 workloads, not a claim
of general register-class or multi-target spilling. New support should extend
the reusable DBI infrastructure only when a concrete probe and target require
it.

Barrier/atomic VGPR patchers now consume the same plan, and bounded HSA logs
report explicit, dead, descriptor-growth, spill, and unsupported outcomes plus
planned and emitted spill bytes.

### Coverage disposition and lowering ledger

MOI coverage is derived from one per-final-code-site ledger rather than from
the candidates or patches that survive filtering. Each record first retains a
semantic `disposition` (`not_applicable`, `supported`, or `unsupported`) and a
stable semantic `reason`. A second, independent lowering layer is finalized
after register planning and patch emission:

- semantic exclusions retain `NotApplicable` or `Unsupported` and never become
  resource or placement failures;
- a supported site with an unsupported register plan becomes
  `ResourceFailed`, with category `UnsupportedResourcePlan` and the exact
  `ConSanRegisterPlanReason`;
- a supported site with no emitted patch becomes
  `PlacementOrLoweringFailed`, with `InstrumentationPatchMissing` rather than
  a free-form warning;
- an emitted site becomes `Patched`. A Sampled barrier body covering a typed
  multi-event sequence marks every exact member event patched, not only the
  branch anchor.

For MOI, the hook consumes these durable outcomes symmetrically for access,
barrier, atomic, and fence counts. For each kind it enforces the accounting
shape

```text
discovered = supported + unsupported
supported = selected + expert_limit_omitted
selected = patched + resource_failed + placement_or_lowering_failed
```

and completeness requires every failure or omission term to be zero. Relevant
unsupported-only objects therefore remain applicable and incomplete. The hook
emits one `coverage_site` record for every semantically relevant site,
retaining kind, semantic disposition/reason, lowering outcome/reason, detailed
register reason, container ownership, kernel/function scope, text offset, and
mnemonic. Only `NotApplicable` records are omitted, preventing unrelated
instructions from adding noise while preserving exact patched eligibility.

The independent Python gate owns its own stable-vocabulary and tuple checks;
it does not trust producer completeness booleans. It retains hook diagnostics
as typed rows and exposes them in JSON. The contained fault runner imports the
same strict parser rather than implementing a second permissive grammar, so
every retained row carries per-site eligibility, reasons, and source location.
Malformed site evidence remains an explicit parse error and makes runner-level
coverage evidence incomplete, so an otherwise passing row becomes
`evidence_incomplete` while preserving its result JSON. Per reader and event
kind, the parser requires site-row cardinality to equal `discovered` and
reconciles disposition and terminal-outcome counts; dropping even a patched
site row fails the evidence contract. The user-facing vocabulary and exact
names are listed in [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#coverage-and-diagnostics).

The aggregate record carries explicit `flavor` and `engine` identity.
SuperCollider derives access totals from its LDS/flat inventory and emitted
patches, but does not manufacture MOI lowering dispositions. Its aggregate
accounting remains strict; only MOI readers participate in exact
`coverage_site` cardinality reconciliation.

## SuperCollider flavor

### Purpose

SuperCollider is the simplest flavor. It preserves
the original memory access, inserts a delay, repeats or reads back the same LDS
address, compares values, and reports a mismatch.

The NVIDIA Research paper [“SuperCollider: Scalable and Effective Data Race
Detection for
CUDA”](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2026-06_supercollider-scalable-and-effective-data-race-detection-cuda)
by Stephenson et al. (PLDI 2026) describes the redundant-read idea as issuing
"a redundant read to the same address" after delay. ConSan implements that core
technique after register allocation, directly in AMD final native code. Its
binary rewriting, reporting path, supported memory spaces, and current semantic
contract are ConSan-specific rather than a wholesale port of the CUDA system.
The current implementation is RDNA4 / `gfx1201`-centric.

### Current algorithm

For a load:

```text
original LDS or likely-group-flat load
delay
duplicate load into scratch VGPRs
wait for the duplicate access
compare original destination VGPRs with scratch VGPRs
report mismatch
restore VCC if needed
return to original fallthrough
```

For a store:

```text
original LDS or likely-group-flat store
delay
synthesized readback into scratch VGPRs
wait for the readback
compare original store data with scratch VGPRs
report mismatch
restore VCC if needed
return to original fallthrough
```

Delay modes:

- `RJ_CONSAN_DELAY_MODE=nop`: emit `RJ_CONSAN_DELAY` copies of `s_nop 0`.
- `RJ_CONSAN_DELAY_MODE=sleep`: emit one `s_sleep N` when delay is nonzero.
- `RJ_CONSAN_DELAY_MODE=sleep_var`: emit one `s_sleep_var` from
  `RJ_CONSAN_DELAY_VAR_SSRC` when delay is nonzero.

Reporting:

- Default `RJ_CONSAN_SC_REPORT_MODE=auto`: the hook allocates and zeroes one
  device-visible sticky marker for each relevant code object, patches its
  address, reads and summarizes it at teardown, and frees it. Allocation
  failure records incomplete analysis and loads original code under fail-open
  behavior; fail-closed or require-patch policy rejects it. It never silently
  falls back to a trap.
- Explicit `RJ_CONSAN_REPORT_BUFFER=0xADDR`: write
  `RJ_CONSAN_REPORT_MARKER` to one caller-owned device-visible word and
  continue.
- Expert `RJ_CONSAN_SC_REPORT_MODE=trap`: execute `s_trap 0` on mismatch.

The marker-buffer ABI is intentionally small. It proves a non-trapping mismatch
path exists, but it does not record PC, lane, LDS address, values, or counts.
The marker is measured redundant-access instability, not a causal race
diagnostic. A race-free program can legitimately advance another wave between
the original and repeated access. Qualification therefore retains this channel
separately from MOI diagnostics and requires a bounded clean/fault differential
before claiming fault sensitivity.

### Fault and perturbation composition

Barrier and atomic fault injection compose with SuperCollider perturbation as a
staged transaction. ConSan inventories the pristine image and retains the exact
selected candidate, sequence, anchor, container, and descriptor owner in a
private internal plan. It validates the mutation, instruments that staged
image, and then validates the complete pristine-to-output transformation. The
internal carrier is not a public option and cannot be supplied by host controls.
If either stage is unsupported or invalid, ConSan rolls back the mutation and
returns no replacement image.

Barrier moves translate the selected edge into the owned whole-pair trampoline;
barrier drops fail closed if they destroy that edge. Atomic address and scope
faults normally mutate the atomic member while perturbation remains anchored on
an outer cache edge. Order weakening can remove the exact cache operation that
is also the perturbation anchor. In that overlap case the perturbation
trampoline carries only the mutation's NOP replacement and validation rejects
any attempt to resurrect the removed cache operation. Partial atomic overlaps
are rejected.

The proof establishes exact identity, ownership, byte accounting, branch
placement, mutation retention, and rollback. SuperCollider may expose value
instability caused by a weakened sequence; it does not claim exact
happens-before reconstruction.

### Current instruction coverage

Native LDS check/trap supports:

- `ds_load_b32`
- `ds_load_b64`
- `ds_load_b128`
- `ds_load_2addr_b32`
- `ds_load_2addr_b64`
- `ds_load_2addr_stride64_b32`
- `ds_load_2addr_stride64_b64`
- `ds_load_u16_d16`
- `ds_load_u16_d16_hi`
- `ds_store_b32`
- `ds_store_b64`
- `ds_store_b128`

Likely group/LDS flat check/trap supports RDNA4 12-byte VFLAT:

- `flat_load_b32`
- `flat_load_b64`
- `flat_load_b128`
- `flat_store_b32`
- `flat_store_b64`
- `flat_store_b128`

Current exclusions:

- ordinary global-memory instrumentation;
- unsupported flat widths such as b8, b16, and b96;
- arbitrary flat accesses with unknown provenance;
- atomics as SuperCollider duplicate-access checks;
- async copies;
- same-value lost-update checks within one wave;
- structured race reports.

### Flat/VFLAT rationale

Flat support is in scope because real compiled HIP helper code can access LDS
through flat/generic pointers. Source-level `__shared__` does not guarantee
that final machine code will use `ds_*` instructions. Once optimization has
materialized a generic pointer, the final instruction selector may emit
`flat_load_*` or `flat_store_*`; the pointer value decides whether the access
reaches the LDS aperture.

ConSan therefore classifies flat sites using a machine-code provenance tracker.
The reported classifications are:

- `Group`
- `Private`
- `MaybeGroup`
- `MaybePrivate`
- `Global`
- `Unknown`

`Group` means that both 32-bit halves were coherently traced from
`src_shared_base`. `MaybeGroup` means only a component, select, or arithmetic
chain remains consistent with that origin; it is a heuristic, not a proof for
arbitrary binaries. `RJ_CONSAN_FLAT_PROVENANCE=likely` (the default) admits
both classifications. `strict` admits only `Group` for investigations that
prefer provenance precision over flat-site recall. Inventory and verbose site
logs retain the classifications independently of this selection policy, and
skipped-candidate warnings count strict-policy exclusions.

For an admitted RDNA4 flat group pointer in `v[addr:addr+1]`, ConSan's LDS
normalization contract is: `v[addr]` is the unsigned byte offset within the LDS
aperture and `v[addr+1]` is provenance evidence only. Static VFLAT `ioffset`
bytes are added to the low word before rounding the byte interval to 4-byte
shadow cells. The high word must never be mixed into the shadow index. Sites
whose encoding or provenance cannot satisfy this contract remain unpatched.

### Current limitations

- Delay is deterministic or scalar-source based rather than randomized.
- The automatic marker reports only that some redundant observation changed;
  it does not retain the address, lane, values, count, or causal peer.
- `MaybeGroup` flat provenance is heuristic.
- Instruction lowering and live qualification are currently gfx1201-specific.
- The reusable VGPR spill backend is also gfx1201-specific and is exercised
  primarily by the larger MOI probes.

## MOI flavor

### Purpose

MOI is the structured race-detection flavor. It models accesses, owners,
epochs, barriers, and selected atomic ordering events. Within its admitted
forms and retained capacities, it can provide causal attribution that
SuperCollider's value-instability marker cannot.

MOI is LDS-focused in the current design. Global memory is intentionally out
of scope except where selected atomics/fences provide ordering evidence for
LDS communication.

### Shared semantic model

MOI records or computes:

- access kind: read or write;
- LDS byte offset and byte count;
- 4-byte LDS shadow-cell range;
- workgroup identity;
- owner identity within a workgroup;
- epoch/order state;
- source instruction offset;
- selected synchronization and atomic events.

The supported-form conflict predicate is, in simplified terms:

- same workgroup;
- overlapping LDS cell/range;
- at least one write;
- different owner;
- same unordered epoch, unless atomic/barrier semantics establish ordering.

Record/Replay is the semantic reference. Inline Shadow and Sampled should match
it where they claim the same semantics and document lower fidelity where they
do not.

### Report-buffer ABI

The MOI report buffer starts with `ConSanMoiReportHeader` and then engine-
specific sections. The header includes counts, capacities, dropped-record
signals, and offsets/capacities for:

- access records;
- barrier records;
- atomic records;
- diagnostics;
- exact-shadow entries;
- inline atomic release slots;
- inline causal snapshots and acquired-epoch tokens;
- sampled watchpoints.

Report-buffer sources:

- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_REPORT_BUFFER=0xADDR` and
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_REPORT_BUFFER_SIZE=N`: caller-supplied buffer.
- With no caller buffer, the HSA tool inventories relevant MOI sites, plans the
  exact engine layout, allocates those bytes below the configured ceilings,
  and summarizes it at teardown.
- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_AUTO_REPORT_BUFFER_SIZE=N`: expert allocation cap; the ordinary
  planner still requests exact inventory-sized bytes below it. Explicit zero
  disables auto allocation. Dynamic access append requires an explicit finite
  cap because its execution count is not statically predictable.

The auto-buffer path is the practical path for IREE and other applications that
cannot add a sanitizer kernel argument.

#### Accepted bounded-memory policy

Ordinary `standard-v1` allocation is governed by an exact, checked plan derived
from final-code inventory rather than an engine-wide default:

| Engine | Inventory-derived report requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Record/Replay | Header/alignment plus exact capacities for every admitted static logical access range and every enabled barrier, atomic, fence, and finite diagnostic region. Exhaustive per-lane dynamic append is excluded from the ordinary completeness contract. |
| Sampled | Header/alignment plus the admitted logical ranges, each range's configured bounded dynamic-window bank, paired synchronization metadata, pending-acquire state, and finite diagnostics. |
| Inline Shadow | Header/alignment plus 16 dispatch banks, each with one versioned exact-shadow slot for every four-byte cell in the maximum declared LDS span of the owning kernels, finite diagnostics, and only the release, snapshot, and acquired-token tables required by enabled ordering instrumentation. |

All additions, multiplications, alignments, and conversions are checked. One
automatic report buffer may require at most **16 MiB**, and the sum of live
automatic report buffers in a process may be at most **256 MiB**. These are
hard safety ceilings rather than allocation quanta. The allocator reserves the
exact planned bytes below them and accounts the reservation against the
process ceiling before exposing its device address.

Arithmetic overflow, either ceiling, or allocation failure yields the typed
`insufficient_report_capacity` result with a stable subreason and required,
available, and live-byte values. It is a static incomplete verdict: ordinary
operation neither truncates the admitted inventory nor silently disables an
event kind or window to fit. Explicit expert sizes are subject to the same
ceilings for now. An explicit zero continues to disable automatic allocation.

`RJ_CONSAN_MOI_DYNAMIC_ACCESS_RECORDS=1` remains a bounded expert experiment.
No static estimator can infer its dynamic per-lane execution volume, and an
allocation below the safety ceiling is not a completeness claim. Its capacity,
visible records, drops, and `dynamic_complete` verdict are always retained.

The memory ledger retains, per code object and in process aggregates: engine
and settings version, admitted inventory, required and allocated bytes,
required and allocated capacity for every ABI region, current and peak live
auto-report bytes, allocation/free outcome, descriptor LDS growth,
private-spill growth, and every saturation, undercoverage, overflow, and
dropped-evidence counter. This ledger is an acceptance artifact, not
verbose-only debugging output.

Acceptance guards:

- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_REQUIRE_RECORDS=1`: fail at teardown if no auto buffer has
  visible access, barrier, atomic, diagnostic, exact-shadow, or sampled data.
- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_REQUIRE_DIAGNOSTICS=1`: fail if no diagnostic/conflict signal
  is observed.
- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_FORBID_DIAGNOSTICS=1`: fail if any diagnostic/conflict signal
  is observed.
- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_REQUIRE_REPLAY_CONFLICT=1`: stricter `record_replay` guard
  that requires host replay to emit a conflict.
- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_FORBID_OVERFLOW=1`: fail at teardown if an auto buffer dropped
  access, barrier, atomic, or diagnostic records. Overflow is always printed to
  stderr even without this guard.

### Record/Replay engine

`RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=record_replay` is the recommended starting engine and the
reference model for the other MOI engines.

Current implementation:

- Patches every admitted supported native DS and likely-group-flat access under
  ordinary settings.
- Emits `ConSanMoiAccessRecord` entries.
- Supports static per-site slots by default.
- Supports dynamic per-lane append with
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_DYNAMIC_ACCESS_RECORDS=1`.
- Records dynamic event indexes.
- Patches supported RDNA4 barrier sites by default; explicit
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_TRACK_BARRIERS=0` is an expert compatibility override.
- Records a narrow RDNA4 no-SADDR `flat_atomic*` subset by default; explicit
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_TRACK_ATOMICS=0` disables it for focused bring-up.
- Replays visible records on the host into exact-shadow diagnostics.
- Coalesces contiguous same-workgroup barrier-arrival runs into one logical
  epoch advance.
- Models selected release/acquire atomic ordering on the host.

Important current simplifications:

- Static access-record slots overwrite on repeated execution of the same site.
- Dynamic access append automatically allocates its EXEC/VCC/SCC scalar window;
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_EXEC_SAVE_SGPR` is an optional debug override.
- Dynamic append can consume records quickly because it writes per active lane.
- Some candidates are skipped near compiler-generated EXEC-mask regions until
  control-flow and liveness handling are stronger.
- Atomic DBI support is narrow and serves as LDS ordering evidence, not
  global-memory race detection.

Design role:

- Provide the clearest inspectable semantics at low measured end-to-end
  workload overhead.
- Serve as the reference model for Inline Shadow and Sampled behavior.
- Report bounded-snapshot limits honestly: static slots can overwrite, so a
  clean replay is not proof of race freedom.
- Preserve clarity rather than optimizing away the reference semantics.

### Inline Shadow engine

`RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=inline_shadow` is the immediate supported-form GPU-side
engine. It updates and checks shadow state during kernel execution instead of
logging each access for host replay.

Current implementation:

- Uses the shared MOI report buffer.
- Uses an inventory-sized ABI-v9 layout with 16 dispatch-selected banks, each
  containing one versioned slot per four-byte cell in the maximum declared LDS
  span of the owning kernels, plus only the required finite diagnostic and
  ordering regions. Banking keeps unrelated concurrent dispatches off the same
  hot slot in the external table. A caller-owned partial shadow cannot qualify
  merely because one execution touches less LDS than the owner declares.
- Instruments decoded native scalar, B64, B128, d16, and two-address LDS
  loads/stores, publishing every rounded 4-byte cell in each access range.
- Instruments supported zero-offset flat/VFLAT loads and stores admitted by
  the configured flat-provenance policy. The low address VGPR is normalized as
  the LDS byte offset and feeds the same cell-range publisher as native DS.
- Uses a versioned compare/exchange transaction to publish external exact
  shadow state and obtain one stable prior entry. Native LDS paths use a
  workgroup-local 64-bit exchange when a local mirror fits.
- Reports a conflict when the prior entry is non-empty, from a different owner,
  in the same epoch, and not read/read.
- Automatically initializes persistent owner/epoch VGPRs at each owning kernel
  entry. When shared atomic helpers need launch identity, it also persists an
  exact nonzero workgroup key there instead of rereading guest-reusable launch
  SGPRs at a late call site.
- Increments an epoch VGPR after supported barrier sites by default.
- Represents supported atomic release/acquire ordering with bounded
  direct-mapped release, causal-snapshot, and pair-scoped acquired-token
  tables. A publisher atomically replaces any stable even release slot;
  acquire lookup imports an edge only after exact dispatch, workgroup, and
  address qualification. Same-wave releases of one object are coalesced behind
  the winning version transaction, while true simultaneous slot collisions
  remain observable as coverage loss.

Current diagnostic shape:

- atomically reserves one slot per conflicting wave and writes up to the
  configured diagnostic capacity;
- records kind, backend, generation, owners, access kinds, instruction offsets,
  and epoch when configured;
- records both LDS ranges and the current conflict EXEC mask; the prior lane
  mask remains unknown because it is not present in the exact-shadow word;
- reports count-over-capacity as dropped diagnostics.

Important current simplifications:

- Native byte/d16 accesses conservatively cover their rounded 4-byte cell;
  byte-precise masks are not represented.
- Direct-kernel owner, epoch, scratch VGPRs, and SGPR temporaries are automatic;
  explicit register variables remain debug overrides.
- Entry-captured `workitem_id` is the ordinary owner source. Inline Shadow
  prefers persistent descriptor-backed owner/epoch VGPRs because owner state
  is consumed at every hot access; private scratch is the capacity fallback.
- `hw_id` remains an expert owner source. It is wave-uniform and automatically
  receives a fresh scalar temporary when the kernel has capacity.
- Atomic ordering metadata is finite and direct-mapped; exhausted contention
  retries or a simultaneous collision between distinct objects makes the
  dynamic-completeness verdict false.
- Diagnostics are bounded first-N records, not an unbounded trace.

Design role:

- Provide the strongest current supported-form immediate attribution without
  retaining a full event trace.
- Extend flat/VFLAT encoding coverage beyond the current supported forms while
  preserving the explicit provenance policy.
- Use automatic scratch/spill policy instead of manual register knobs.
- Emit structured bounded diagnostics that are useful without reading raw logs.

### Sampled engine

`RJ_CONSAN_MOI_ENGINE=sampled` is the statistical engine. It retains selected
causal windows instead of attempting to preserve every dynamic event.

Current implementation:

- Uses the ordinary `standard-v1` runtime sampling policy (stride 16,384,
  offset zero) without workload-specific settings. The environment variables
  remain expert overrides for controlled statistical campaigns.
- Leaves every admitted supported static access site patched under ordinary
  settings.
- Writes compact 64-bit sampled watchpoint entries directly from DBI probes.
- Assigns one logical sampled range per decoded access range. When runtime
  sampling is enabled and report capacity permits, each logical range receives
  a power-of-two bank of as many as eight immutable dynamic windows. Access
  and barrier probes choose the same bank from dispatch/workgroup identity.
- Packs valid/consumed bits, access kind, owner, epoch, generation, and LDS
  cell range.
- Uses generation zero in direct DBI mode.
- Supports expert static-site subsampling with `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_SAMPLE_STRIDE`
  and `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_SAMPLE_OFFSET`; ordinary settings select every admitted
  static site.
- Can leave every eligible static site patched while deterministically
  selecting runtime accesses with `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_RUNTIME_SAMPLE_STRIDE` and
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_RUNTIME_SAMPLE_OFFSET`. The power-of-two policy mixes hardware
  dispatch ID, workgroup, wave, epoch, persistent per-wave sequence, site, and
  address through a strong finalizer before comparing the selected residue; it
  preserves VCC in an automatically allocated scalar pair.
- Treats a repeated claim for the exact stored dispatch/workgroup/epoch/site
  causal identity as the same retained sample. A different identity arriving
  after every immutable bank is occupied is explicit bounded saturation, not
  a malformed record or publication-loss drop. True drops remain separate and
  make strict acceptance inconclusive.
- Publishes typed barrier synchronization metadata into the bank selected by
  the same dynamic identity, so host replay can classify sampled causal
  windows without joining unrelated dispatches.
- Auto-buffer probes publish the buffer generation in every sampled entry.
  Host replay ignores entries from older generations, scans the active entries
  at HSA-tool teardown, and reports sampled conflict counts.
- With `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_SAMPLED_CHECK=1`, logical range `i` checks the
  corresponding bank of the immediately preceding logical range before
  publishing. Matching valid generation and epoch, owner inequality,
  conflicting access kinds, and exact cell range increment the report header's
  sampled immediate-conflict counter on the GPU. The HSA summary and diagnostic
  guards consume that counter without waiting for host pairwise replay.
- Keeps host-side sampled publish/replay helpers as semantic references.

Important current simplifications:

- Runtime selection is deterministic for the full dynamic identity but varies
  over a wave's persistent access sequence. It is statistical coverage, not a
  deterministic detection guarantee.
- The in-kernel checker compares one adjacent logical range/bank and exact
  ranges rather than scanning the table or testing all overlapping ranges. Its
  counter is an immediate signal, not a structured full diagnostic record.
- There is no in-kernel whole-table sampled conflict checker.
- Clean sampled output is inconclusive.
- Owner/epoch values are masked to the current compact 10-bit fields before
  packing.

Design role:

- Provide bounded statistical evidence without retaining an exhaustive event
  history.
- Keep the automatic runtime policy usable without workload-specific tuning
  and characterize its detection rate on real faults.
- Improve table-wide and overlapping-range checking without turning the
  ordinary engine into an exhaustive trace.
- Continue documenting that the Sampled engine can miss races.

## Owner and workgroup identity

MOI separates:

- workgroup identity: `(workgroup_x, workgroup_y, workgroup_z)`;
- owner identity: the logical peer inside a workgroup used by conflict checks.

Current workgroup identity is stronger than current owner identity. Access and
barrier probes can read RDNA4 launch TTMP payload fields and record 3D
workgroup coordinates, so host replay avoids cross-workgroup comparisons.

The ordinary owner source for every MOI engine is
`RJ_CONSAN_MOI_OWNER_SOURCE=workitem_id`. ConSan captures it at kernel entry,
before `v0` becomes reusable guest state, and derives the current estimate as
`workitem_id_x >> log2(wavefront_size)`. Inline Shadow stores the result in its
automatically allocated persistent owner state when possible.

Expert/debug alternatives are:

- an explicit owner VGPR through `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_OWNER_VGPR`;
- explicit prologue initialization through
  `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_INIT_OWNER_EPOCH=1`; and
- `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_OWNER_SOURCE=hw_id`, which uses RDNA4 `HW_ID1` low bits. An
  explicit `RJ_CONSAN_MOI_OWNER_SGPR` remains a debug override.

The `workitem_id` estimate is adequate when captured at entry for current 1D
two-wave controls. It is not a complete owner derivation for arbitrary 2D/3D
local invocation layouts, and `v0` cannot be treated as workitem identity after
entry because it is ordinary guest state by then.

The `hw_id` source is useful for targeted experiments because it is
wave-uniform and does not depend on local invocation dimensionality. It is not
the ordinary Inline Shadow operating point: deriving it in every hot probe is
materially more expensive than entry-initialized persistent state. Its
temporary is chosen above all guest scalar references and descriptor-backed;
full-SGPR kernels fail visibly rather than borrowing an unproven register.

Current boundary and direction:

- Keep 3D workgroup identity.
- Use a robust owner derivation that does not require user-selected registers.
- Preserve `hw_id` as a useful low-level source where appropriate.
- Owner/epoch state is integrated with the common scratch/spill policy. Broaden
  the identity encoding only when a concrete workload exceeds its packed
  bounds.

## Barrier and atomic semantics

Barriers:

- `record_replay` appends barrier-arrival records and host replay coalesces
  contiguous same-workgroup arrivals into logical epoch advances.
- `inline_shadow` can trampoline supported barriers, execute the original
  barrier, and increment an epoch VGPR after the barrier. Exact-shadow packing
  masks that monotonically incremented value to 10 bits, so long-running
  kernels use epochs modulo 1024 without corrupting neighboring metadata
  fields. A conflict separated by exactly 1024 barrier epochs can therefore be
  conservatively reported as unordered.
- `sampled` publishes typed barrier synchronization metadata into the same
  dynamically selected bank as the causal access window. Host scanning uses
  it to avoid joining unrelated dispatch/workgroup/epoch identities.

Atomics:

- MOI treats atomics as ordering events for LDS, not as global-memory race
  checks.
- `record_replay` has host-side release/acquire modeling and a narrow DBI
  atomic-record path.
- `inline_shadow` has bounded address-scoped release/acquire metadata.
- `sampled` publishes admitted atomic/fence synchronization evidence into its
  selected causal windows.

Current atomic support is intentionally narrow. Broader opcode coverage should
follow concrete semantic controls rather than being inferred from compatibility
runs.

## Current boundaries and future direction

The current implementation deliberately retains several bounded or
target-specific mechanisms:

- optional manual register debug overrides;
- a gfx1201-only ordinary-VGPR spill backend rather than general register-class
  spilling;
- conservative versioned ordinary settings with advanced extensions kept
  opt-in;
- `MaybeGroup` flat LDS provenance;
- static Record/Replay snapshots and bounded Sampled window banks;
- finite direct-mapped Inline atomic ordering tables;
- bounded Inline diagnostics and a deliberately narrow admitted atomic
  vocabulary;
- deterministic or scalar-source delay instead of a randomized perturbation
  schedule;
- IREE correctness tests that establish patchability and non-corruption but do
  not, by themselves, establish race detection. Separate contained
  fault-injection rows supply that evidence.

Together, the implementation and validation establish these core DBI building
blocks:

- HSA-level interception works.
- Final native RDNA4 / `gfx1201` code can be decoded and patched.
- Native DS and likely-group-flat sites can be found.
- Compact IREE kernels can be patched through local or appended caves.
- HSA-tool-owned report buffers make MOI usable without application ABI
  changes.
- Host replay, inline exact shadow, and sampled publication can all observe
  DBI-written state.

These results should not be mistaken for multi-target completeness. The
direction remains a small set of well-defined flavor/engine choices with
automatic resource management, defensible LDS classification, clear bounded
diagnostics, and reproducible target-specific validation.

## Validation evidence

The executable authority is `tests/dbi/consan/consan_validation.py`, documented
in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md). It binds exact workload commands, canonical
flavor/engine configurations, coverage/oracle/health gates, fault identities
and expected outcomes, overhead, memory, and provenance. The validation CLI
and schema call those canonical configurations “profiles”; that term does not
introduce another runtime selection layer. `explain --json` exposes the full
contract before execution and identifies workload-specific tuning; ordinary
clean configurations currently require none.

[STATUS_RDNA4.md](STATUS_RDNA4.md) is the concise measured result ledger. A
green cell includes clean correctness, admitted supported-site coverage,
exact-fault detection or a precommitted qualified miss, bounded termination,
device health, no-fault latency, memory, and retained evidence. Green does not
mean every flavor or engine detects every fault, and a passing workload does
not prove race freedom.

Focused unit and live HIP tests remain the tight implementation loop, but test
counts evolve and are intentionally not frozen here. GPU fanout is at most four;
destructive rows are serialized.

## Remaining engineering boundary

The register-resource path is in place: non-spill allocation, gfx1201
spill-backed access/barrier/atomic probes, zero-to-nonzero dispatch scratch,
persistent-state fallbacks, scalar/special-state policy, compatible
shared-function assignments, and bounded outcome summaries.

The reusable backend and its relationship to Kunwar Grover's
`users/Groverkss/text-relocation-land` work are documented in
[AMDGPU register spilling](../spilling.md). ConSan integrates that backend with
Record/Replay, Sampled, and Inline Shadow probes; later work is broader target
coverage rather than another ConSan allocator.

If ConSan needs SGPR spilling, assume it is not already covered there. Implement
only the minimal SGPR support needed for the current probe family, keep it
isolated, and prefer deleting or replacing it when shared rocJITsu spilling
lands.

The cumulative gfx1201 release certificate is complete. Detector-strength,
hardening, workload-breadth, and other-target work are tracked in
[FUTURE_WORK.md](FUTURE_WORK.md).

## Barrier-mutation qualification boundary

Barrier fault-injection evidence is intentionally split into host code-object,
live-GPU, and cluster/multi-device dimensions. The typed
`consan_barrier_mutation_qualification` table in `consan_options.h.inc` is the
enforceable source of truth; encoder availability alone does not upgrade a row.

Cross-block whole-barrier movement also has an explicit typed CFG contract.
`CompletingStructuredDiamond` is the non-destructive conditional control: the
destination lies in a two-successor guard, the original pair begins the common
reconverged block, and each distinct acyclic arm has exactly the guard as its
predecessor and the source as its successor. This preserves one barrier-pair
execution for every traversal that reached the original source. Final
validation rebuilds the pristine CFG and rederives the complete contract.

`DestructiveStructuredExecDiamond` is deliberately separate. It places the
pair in one EXEC-narrowed optional arm, requires the destructive opt-in, and is
eligible only under explicit destructive containment. Neither option is
accepted for the other contract, and arbitrary cross-block or cyclic
placements remain rejected.

| Target and mutation | Host code-object proof | Live GPU | Cluster/multi-device |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gfx1201` signal/wait scope crossing (`-1` to `-3`) | Proven: exact pair rewrite, decoded scope change, and final byte proof | Not qualified | Not qualified |
| `gfx1201` completing ID control | Not qualified | Not qualified | Not qualified |
| `gfx1250` complete static named lifecycle retarget | Proven: init/join/signal/wait rewrite, fixed-zero leave, exact validation, and MOI composition/rollback | Hardware-deferred | Not qualified |
| `gfx1250` static named-lifecycle participant count | Proven: exact literal-M0 setup discovery, count-only rewrite, and final byte/adjacency proof | Hardware-deferred | Not qualified |

There is no safe gfx1201 completing-ID live control to add from the current
encodings. `-2` is a trap barrier, `-3` and `-4` are cluster barriers, and the
positive named-barrier completion lifecycle used by this work is a gfx1250
instruction family. Consequently no current single-gfx1201 run may be cited as
cluster, multi-device, or gfx1250 lifecycle qualification. See
[VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the executable target qualification
boundary.

Participant mutation deliberately has a narrower encoding contract than
lifecycle ID retargeting. The locally authoritative LLVM AMDGPU definitions
model `llvm.amdgcn.s.barrier.init(ptr, i32 memberCnt)`, and instruction
selection packs the named barrier ID into M0 bits 5:0 and the member count into
M0 bits 21:16. ConSan therefore admits a count rewrite only when
`s_barrier_init m0` is immediately preceded by a literal `s_mov_b32 m0`, the
reserved bits are zero, and both the named ID and member count are in their
valid encoded ranges. It changes only bits 21:16 and validates that the setup
instruction, barrier adjacency, ID, and reserved bits remain unchanged.

Dynamic M0 construction cannot prove the stored count without data-flow
analysis. Immediate barrier-init encodings carry the barrier ID rather than a
member count, and the verified encoding contains no participant-mask field.
Those cases consequently produce an explicit typed `Unsupported` result. This
host code-object proof is not a claim of live gfx1250 qualification; that
remains hardware-deferred.
