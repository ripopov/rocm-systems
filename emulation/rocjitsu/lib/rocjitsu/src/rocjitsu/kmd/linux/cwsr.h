/// emulator hosts wave state in the daemon, so on a wave stop it must write that
/// state into the (memfd-shared) CWSR area at exactly the offsets dbgapi
/// computes. This module reproduces the gfx9.4 layout used by CDNA3/CDNA4
/// (gfx942/gfx950), cross-checked against projects/rocdbgapi/src/architecture.cpp
/// (gfx90a/gfx9_4/mi cwsr_record_t). Earlier gfx9 generations differ: gfx908
/// saves an ACC-VGPR block, and gfx908/gfx90a keep the packet id in TTMP6.
